Names for Potato Latkes
The wonderful fried potato pancakes go by many names. In my home, we called them draniki, or kartoflyaniki, some people call them potato pancakes, and in the Jewish cuisine, they’re called potato latkes.

Different name, but all the same deliciousness.  All made with shredded potatoes and all equally wonderful.

Potato Latkes taste just like pan-fried potatoes, but crispy in every single bite. Add sour cream to that, and you’ve just transferred yourself to potato heaven. It really doesn’t get any better than this. To me, they’re the ultimate comfort food. It’s what my grandma used to make for breakfast and that was just one of the many reasons, why I loved my grandma. She was awesome like that.

How to make the perfect Potato Latkes
When frying the potato latkes, make sure to spread the batter relatively thin, as that makes the pancakes crispy and which is the best part about these!

I always fry and serve them at the same time. Meaning, my daughter and husband are right there ready to get them super crispy, right from the skillet.

Having two skillets going at the same time makes this process faster. As the potato pancakes sit, they become softer, that is why having a conveyor belt of frying and eating right away works out the best, ha!

I make Potato Latkes extremely rare, but when I do, I make sure to make a lot and invite some family over to enjoy them together. I mean, with the amount of calories this thing has, might as well feel guilty as a group, ha!
